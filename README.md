# Confirmed-Covid-19-Cases-worldwide report and worldwide_happiness_report to determine correlation between spread of Covid 19 in country and how happy are people living in that country

This repository contains an analysis of two datasets - the "Confirmed-Covid-19-Cases-worldwide" report and the "worldwide_happiness_report" - to determine whether there is a correlation between the spread of Covid-19 in a country and the happiness of the people living in that country.

The "Confirmed-Covid-19-Cases-worldwide" report provides information on the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in each country as of the date of the dataset. The dataset used in this analysis was last updated on [insert date].

The "worldwide_happiness_report" is an annual report that ranks countries based on how happy their citizens are. The dataset used in this analysis is from [insert year].

The analysis involves merging the two datasets based on the country name and analyzing the relationship between Covid-19 cases and the happiness score of the country. The analysis is performed using Python and various data analysis libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

The main files in this repository are:

covid19_happiness_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
covid19_cases.csv: The Covid-19 cases dataset used in the analysis.

To run the analysis, you can clone this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook using a Python environment with the required libraries installed.

Please note that the analysis is based on a snapshot of the data as of the date the datasets were last updated and does not take into account any changes that may have occurred since then.
